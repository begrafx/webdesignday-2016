Resources and information to support the Atomic Design / Pattern Lab workshop at Web Design Day, June 23rd, 2016

## Prework

Workshop attendees can start with their best feet forward if they come with a system ready to start developing with Pattern Lab. Users will need to decide which platform they are more comfortable working within, PHP or Node.

### PHP Setup

Having PHP installed is the only requirement for using the PHP version of Pattern Lab. Mac OS X and Linux come with PHP pre-installed. Windows users can [download and install PHP 5.6](http://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-5.6.22-Win32-VC11-x86.zip). A Zip release of the workshop-compatible set-up of Pattern Lab for PHP will be released on Tuesday, June 21.

### Node Setup

To use the Node version of Pattern Lab, follow the instructions found on the  [Edition Node Gulp repository](https://github.com/pattern-lab/edition-node-gulp).

> Specifically, if you can manage to install all prerequisites prior to the start of the workshop, we will avoid potential problems pulling down all the code from Github.

## Exercise Starterkits

Starterkits are prepackaged sets of frontend assets and patterns that can be built and used to get up and running with a project. A couple starterkits have been created to guide workshop attendees through the exercises and re-align anyone that wants to return to a stable point.

You can find instructions on how to install these starterkits here: [https://github.com/pattern-lab/starterkit-mustache-webdesignday](https://github.com/pattern-lab/starterkit-mustache-webdesignday)
